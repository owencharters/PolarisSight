Please note that Blackboard generally allows files of a decent size, but you may run into limits if you use too many media files or images.  If there are issues, it is acceptable to link to code repositories or additional material via a shared link from dropbox or other cloud host. Obviously it is better if you don't discover these limits 5 minutes before the assignment deadline. 

As far as the submission zip is concerned, please use a structure that matches the one below.  You should use as many of the directories listed as you need. It is not mandatory to use all of them, and you can add a small number of others if we have missed something, but please make it easier for us by using this structure. The image here assumes that you are in a directory called Report as discussed above. 

As noted, the actual report document must appear in the top directory. The remaining directories have the following purposes: 

    Code - any actual source code and tests may be placed here. Alternatively you may link us to a public repo or zip on dropbox or elsewhere. Please organise the file structure logically - we will be browsing your code in development projects
    Data - this can include any data collected or generated over the course of the semester, and it should be sufficient for us to dig a bit deeper on comments made in your report should we wish to do so. 
    Demo - screenshots or videos of the artefact 
    Design - this can include mockups, sketches, or anything else related to design exercises that you have undertaken over the course of the semester.
    Docs - as the name suggests, this is system documentation and user guides. In the case of a consulting report or business analysis, you should put your reports for the client here. 
    Sources - this is intended for those who have undertaken a lot of research and want to share some of the more important source documents with us. 

The deadline is as indicated, but a few comments: 

    This is a group based assessment and you will need to submit as a group. 
    You may submit as many times as you like (please limit this if your submission is large) 
    The deadline is Monday at 11:59PM. The link will remain open for another half an hour in case people have system issues, but it will then disappear. 
    Make sure you have a good submission in the system by say 10PM on Monday. 

All the best.
